The `orientation` parameter allows you to control the orientation of pages in the generated PDF.

## Overview

When generating a PDF, you can choose between portrait (taller than wide) or landscape (wider than tall) orientation. The `orientation` parameter lets you specify which orientation to use for all pages in the document.

## Parameter details

<ResponseField name="orientation" type="enum<string>" default="portrait">
  Controls the orientation of pages in the generated PDF
  
  Available options: `portrait`, `landscape`
</ResponseField>

## Usage

```javascript
{
  "parts": "https://example.com",
  "orientation": "portrait" // or "landscape"
}
```

## Behavior

- **`portrait`**: Creates pages that are taller than they are wide, suitable for typical documents, articles, and reports.
- **`landscape`**: Creates pages that are wider than they are tall, ideal for content with wide tables, charts, or images.

## Use cases

This parameter is particularly useful for:

1. **Data visualization**: Use `landscape` for documents containing wide charts, tables, or diagrams that benefit from horizontal space.

2. **Photo collections**: Use `landscape` for displaying wide-format photographs or panoramic images.

3. **Standard documents**: Use `portrait` for typical text-heavy documents, articles, and reports that read vertically.

4. **Presentation handouts**: Use `landscape` for materials derived from slide presentations to maintain the original aspect ratio.

## Example

### Portrait mode (default)

```javascript
{
  "parts": "https://example.com/annual-report",
  "orientation": "portrait"
}
```

### Landscape mode

```javascript
{
  "parts": "https://example.com/data-dashboard",
  "orientation": "landscape"
}
```

## Combining with size

The `orientation` parameter works in conjunction with the `size` parameter. When both are specified, the orientation is applied to the specified page size.

```javascript
{
  "parts": "https://example.com",
  "size": {
    "preset": "a4"
  },
  "orientation": "landscape"
}
```

In this example, the PDF will be generated with A4 pages in landscape orientation.
