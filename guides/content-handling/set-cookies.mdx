The `set_cookie` parameter allows you to set cookies before the rendering process begins.

## Overview

When rendering webpages that require authentication or personalization, you may need to set specific cookies. The `set_cookie` parameter lets you configure cookies that will be sent with requests during the rendering process.

## Parameter Details

<ResponseField name="set_cookie" type="object">
  Configures cookies that will be sent with requests during the rendering process
  <Expandable title="Properties">
    <ResponseField name="name" type="string" required>
      The name of the cookie to set
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="value" type="string" required>
      The value of the cookie
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="domain" type="string" required>
      The domain for which the cookie is valid
    </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

## Usage

```javascript
{
  "parts": "https://example.com/members-only",
  "set_cookie": {
    "name": "session_id",
    "value": "abc123xyz",
    "domain": "example.com"
  }
}
```

## Behavior

The specified cookie is set before any requests are made during the rendering process. This allows you to:

- Access authenticated content
- View personalized pages
- Bypass login screens
- Render content that requires specific cookie values

## Important Notes

- The `domain` value must match the domain of the URL being rendered
- Only one cookie can be set per request
- Cookies are only valid for the current rendering session

## Use Cases

This parameter is particularly useful for:

1. **Authenticated content**: Render pages that require user login by providing session cookies.

2. **Personalized views**: Capture user-specific views by setting identity or preference cookies.

3. **Testing**: Validate how pages appear with different cookie values.

## Examples

### Accessing a Members-Only Page

```javascript
{
  "parts": "https://example.com/members-only",
  "set_cookie": {
    "name": "session_id",
    "value": "abc123xyz",
    "domain": "example.com"
  }
}
```

### Setting a User Preference

```javascript
{
  "parts": "https://example.com/dashboard",
  "set_cookie": {
    "name": "theme",
    "value": "dark",
    "domain": "example.com"
  }
}
```

### Bypassing a Cookie Consent Banner

```javascript
{
  "parts": "https://example.com",
  "set_cookie": {
    "name": "cookie_consent",
    "value": "accepted",
    "domain": "example.com"
  }
}
```
