Vortex PDF offers two distinct methods for generating PDFs: synchronous and asynchronous processing. Each approach has specific use cases and advantages depending on your application requirements.

## Synchronous processing

With synchronous processing, your API request waits for the PDF generation to complete, and the rendered PDF is returned directly in the response.

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/renderers/pdf` ðŸ”— [API reference](/api-reference/renderers/render-a-pdf-synchronously)

### When to use synchronous processing

- **Immediate PDF delivery** - When you need to return the PDF directly to users
- **Simple documents** - For generating relatively small or simple PDFs (fewer than 10 pages)
- **Interactive applications** - When users are actively waiting for the document
- **Testing and development** - For quicker iteration during development

### How it works

1. Your application makes a request to the synchronous endpoint
2. Vortex PDF renders the document while the connection remains open
3. Once complete, the PDF binary (or base64-encoded string) is returned in the response
4. Your application can immediately use or serve the PDF

## Asynchronous processing

With asynchronous processing, your request is queued for background processing. The API responds immediately with a confirmation, and the generated PDF is stored in your specified cloud storage location.

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/renderers/pdf/async` ðŸ”— [API reference](/api-reference/renderers/render-a-pdf-asynchronously)

### When to use asynchronous processing

- **Large documents** - For generating complex or lengthy PDFs (10+ pages)
- **Batch processing** - When generating multiple PDFs without blocking your application
- **Background jobs** - For non-interactive PDF generation tasks
- **Scheduled reports** - For recurring document generation that doesn't require immediate access
- **High-volume processing** - When handling peaks in PDF generation demand

### How it works

1. Your application makes a request to the asynchronous endpoint
2. Vortex PDF immediately returns a confirmation response
3. The rendering job is processed in the background
4. Upon completion, the PDF is stored in your specified cloud storage location
5. Optionally, a webhook notification is sent to your callback URL
6. In case of transient failures, the system will automatically retry the rendering process up to 5 times before reporting a failure

## Required configuration differences

While most rendering options are identical between the two methods, asynchronous processing has some configuration differences:

| Configuration     | Synchronous                 | Asynchronous                     |
| ----------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `output_encoding` | Required (binary or base64) | Not applicable                   |
| `destination`     | Not applicable              | Optional (cloud storage details) |
| `callback`        | Not applicable              | Optional (webhook URL)           |

<Note>
  Before using custom cloud destinations, you must configure proper
  authorization settings. See [Cloud
  destination](/features/async-processing/cloud-destination#authorization-requirements)
  for detailed setup instructions.
</Note>

### Default storage for async processing

If you don't specify a `destination` parameter for asynchronous processing, Vortex PDF will automatically store your generated PDF in our public cloud storage:

- **Bucket:** `public.vortexpdf.com`
- **Region:** Multiple regions in the United States
- **Lifecycle:** Files are automatically deleted after 14 days
- **Access:** Public URL provided in callback response

This default storage option is perfect for testing, development, or temporary document sharing scenarios.

## Response differences

The synchronous endpoint returns the actual PDF document in the response body, while the asynchronous endpoint returns a confirmation that the job has been accepted.

### Synchronous response

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/pdf
Content-Length: [length]

[PDF binary data]
```

### Asynchronous response

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": "accepted",
  "message": "PDF generation job accepted and queued for processing"
}
```

When using the default storage (no destination specified), the callback response payload will match Google Cloud Storage's response format.

### Example callback payloads

When using asynchronous processing, you'll receive a callback with details about the stored PDF. The payload structure varies depending on the storage provider.

#### Google Cloud Storage

When using Google Cloud Storage as the destination provider:

```json

  "timestamp": "2025-03-18T21:04:02.034537Z"
}
```

#### AWS S3 storage

When using AWS S3 as the destination provider:

```json
{
  "result": {
    "bucket": "partly-gradient",
    "etag": "\"78a731a2e9b5899f73697570c509243c-1\"",
    "key": "sEmNryuv.pdf",
    "location": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/partly-gradient/sEmNryuv.pdf"
  },
  "status": "success",
  "timestamp": "2025-03-18T21:20:29.582393Z"
}
```

#### Error callback payloads

When async PDF generation fails, you'll receive error details in the callback payload:

##### Google Cloud Storage errors

```json
{
  "result": {
    "error": "gcs_error",
    "message": "user@example.com does not have storage.objects.create access to the Google Cloud Storage object. Permission 'storage.objects.create' denied on resource (or it may not exist).",
    "reason": "forbidden"
  },
  "status": "failure",
  "timestamp": "2025-03-19T22:38:03.929130Z"
}
```

```json
{
  "result": {
    "error": "gcs_error",
    "message": "The specified bucket does not exist.",
    "reason": "notFound"
  },
  "status": "failure",
  "timestamp": "2025-03-19T22:37:07.279620Z"
}
```

##### AWS S3 errors

```json
{
  "result": {
    "code": "NoSuchBucket",
    "error": "s3_error",
    "message": "The specified bucket does not exist"
  },
  "status": "failure",
  "timestamp": "2025-03-19T22:42:12.985100Z"
}
```

```json
{
  "result": {
    "code": "AccessDenied",
    "error": "s3_error",
    "message": "Access Denied"
  },
  "status": "failure",
  "timestamp": "2025-03-19T22:42:49.106295Z"
}
```

## Performance considerations

- **Timeouts** - Synchronous requests may timeout for complex documents, especially with many images or complex layouts
- **Connection stability** - Synchronous requests require maintaining an open connection throughout the rendering process
- **Scaling** - Asynchronous processing handles traffic spikes more gracefully by queuing requests
- **Resource utilization** - Asynchronous processing distributes your PDF generation load more evenly
- **Automatic retries** - Asynchronous processing includes automatic retry logic for transient failures, increasing reliability for complex documents

## Example: Synchronous rendering

```json
POST /api/v1/renderers/pdf HTTP/1.1
Host: vortexpdf.com
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "parts": ["https://example.com"],
  "output_encoding": "binary"
}
```

## Example: Asynchronous rendering

```json
POST /api/v1/renderers/pdf/async HTTP/1.1
Host: vortexpdf.com
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "parts": ["https://example.com"],
  "callback": {
    "url": "https://myapp.com/webhook/pdf-complete"
  }
}
```

### With custom destination

```json
POST /api/v1/renderers/pdf/async HTTP/1.1
Host: vortexpdf.com
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "parts": ["https://example.com"],
  "destination": {
    "provider": "aws_s3",
    "bucket": "my-pdf-bucket",
    "path": "reports/example-report.pdf"
  },
  "callback": {
    "url": "https://myapp.com/webhook/pdf-complete"
  }
}
```

## Best practices

- Use synchronous processing for small documents and interactive user experiences
- Switch to asynchronous processing for documents over 10 pages or with complex layouts
- Use the default storage option for rapid development and testing
- Configure your own cloud storage destination when:
  - Running production workloads
  - Handling sensitive or regulated information
  - Needing to comply with data residency requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
  - Requiring specific geographic storage locations
  - Implementing custom retention policies beyond 14 days
- Implement proper error handling for both methods
- Set appropriate timeouts for synchronous requests
- Use webhook callbacks to trigger downstream processes when using asynchronous rendering
