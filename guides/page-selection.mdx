The `pages` parameter allows you to specify which pages from the rendered document should be included in the final PDF output.

## Overview

When generating a PDF from content that spans multiple pages, you may want to include only specific pages or ranges of pages. The `pages` parameter lets you select exactly which pages appear in the final document.

## Parameter Details

<ResponseField name="pages" type="string" default="''">
  Specifies which pages from the rendered document should be included in the final PDF output
  
  Default: Empty string (includes all pages)
</ResponseField>

## Usage

```javascript
{
  "parts": "https://example.com",
  "pages": "1-5, 8, 11-13"
}
```

## Behavior

The `pages` parameter accepts a comma-separated list of page ranges using one-based indexing:

- **Single page**: `"3"` (includes only page 3)
- **Page range**: `"1-5"` (includes pages 1 through 5)
- **Multiple selections**: `"1-5, 8, 11-13"` (includes pages 1-5, page 8, and pages 11-13)
- **Empty string**: `""` (includes all pages)

Important notes:
- Pages will always be included in the document's natural order regardless of the specified range
- Each page will only be included once, even if it appears multiple times in the range specification
- One-based indexing is used (the first page is page 1, not page 0)

## Use Cases

This parameter is particularly useful for:

1. **Extracting specific content**: Include only the relevant pages from a larger document.

2. **Creating document excerpts**: Generate shorter versions of documents with only key pages.

3. **Removing unnecessary pages**: Exclude cover pages, advertisements, or other unwanted content.

4. **Combining specific pages**: Select non-consecutive pages that belong together logically.

## Examples

### Including Only the First Page

```javascript
{
  "parts": "https://example.com",
  "pages": "1"
}
```

### Including a Range of Pages

```javascript
{
  "parts": "https://example.com",
  "pages": "2-10"
}
```

### Including Multiple Ranges and Individual Pages

```javascript
{
  "parts": "https://example.com",
  "pages": "1-3, 5, 7-9"
}
```

### Including All Pages (Default Behavior)

```javascript
{
  "parts": "https://example.com",
  "pages": ""
}
```
