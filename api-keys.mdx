The Vortex PDF API uses Bearer token authentication to secure API requests.

## Overview

API keys are used to authenticate requests to the Vortex PDF API. Each API key is associated with your account.

## Authentication headers

<ResponseField name="Authorization" type="string" required>
  The HTTP header used for authentication
  
  Format: `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`
</ResponseField>

## Usage

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of your HTTP requests:

```bash
curl -X POST https://vortexpdf.com/api/v1/render \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "parts": "https://example.com"
  }'
```

## API key management

### Obtaining API keys

1. Log in to your [Vortex PDF Dashboard](https://vortexpdf.com/dashboard)
2. Navigate to the API Keys section
3. Create a new API key

### Security best practices

- **Keep keys secure**: Never expose your API keys in client-side code or public repositories
- **Use environment variables**: Store API keys in environment variables rather than hardcoding them
- **Rotate keys regularly**: Periodically generate new API keys and deprecate old ones
