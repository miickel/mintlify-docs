The `emulate_media_type` parameter allows you to control which CSS media queries are applied during the rendering process.

## Overview

When rendering a webpage, different CSS styles can be applied based on the intended output medium. The `emulate_media_type` parameter lets you specify which media type to emulate during rendering.

## Parameter Details

<ResponseField name="emulate_media_type" type="enum<string>" default="print">
  Controls which CSS media queries are applied during the rendering process
  
  Available options: `screen`, `print`
</ResponseField>

## Usage

```javascript
{
  "parts": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random",
  "emulate_media_type": "print" // or "screen"
}
```

## Behavior

- **`screen`**: Emulates the screen media type, applying CSS styles intended for display on computer screens, tablets, smartphones, etc.
- **`print`**: Emulates the print media type, applying CSS styles intended for printed output.

## Use Cases

This parameter is particularly useful for:

1. **Print-optimized captures**: Use `print` to capture a version of the page optimized for printing, which may hide navigation elements, adjust colors, or modify layouts.

2. **Web display captures**: Use `screen` to capture the page as it would appear on a typical device screen.

3. **Dual-purpose content delivery**: Maintain a single codebase while being able to generate both web-optimized views (`screen`) and PDF-ready versions (`print`) of the same content.

## Example

Many websites use media queries to provide different styles for screen and print:

```css
/* Styles for screen display */
@media screen {
  .navigation {
    display: block;
  }
  body {
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
  }
}

/* Styles for print output */
@media print {
  .navigation {
    display: none;
  }
  body {
    background-color: white;
  }
}
```

By setting `emulate_media_type` to either `screen` or `print`, you can control which of these styles are applied during rendering.
