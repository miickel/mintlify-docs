## Setting up

Before you can use the API, you need to create an account and get an API key.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Create your account"
    icon="user"
    href="https://vortexpdf.com"
  >
    It's free, requires no credit card, and takes less than a minute.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Get your API key"
    icon="key"
    href="https://mintlify.com/docs/development"
  >
    Once you have an account, you can create an API key.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Show me the code

Insert your API key and make your first API call.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript cURL
curl -X POST 'https://api.vortexpdf.com/v1/pdf' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"text": "Hello, world!"}'
```

Congratulations! You've made your first API call.
